# Pathfinder README

## Description

The application will be a single-page javascript app containing a canvas which will display a grid, and a series of buttons which will demonstrate various maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.  I would like to include at least four of each.  The site will also include links to webpages (external) with information about the algorithms featured, and short descriptions of how each one works in abstract.

## MVP

— Functional grid of squares with buttons to trigger animations.
— Animations for at least two maze generation algorithms.
— Animations for at least two maze-solving algorithms.

## Technologies

Canvas, d3, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Implementation Timeline

1 day, set up canvas, grid, cell logic

2 days, implement algorithms

1 day, finish implementing algorithms, do styling
