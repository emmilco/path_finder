# Pathfinder README

## MVP

The application will be a single-page javascript app containing a canvas which will display a grid, and a series of buttons which will demonstrate various maze generation and pathfinding algorithms.  I would like to include at least four of each.  The site will also include links to webpages (external) with information about the algorithms featured, and short descriptions of how each one works in abstract.

## Technologies

Canvas

## Backend

None.

## Implementation Timeline

1 day, set up canvas, grid, cell logic
2 days, implement algorithms
1 day, finish implementing algorithms, do styling
